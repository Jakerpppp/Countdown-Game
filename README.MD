# Countdown Problem Solver in C++

Welcome to the Countdown Problem Solver implemented in C++ using Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)!
- Made in October-November 2023

## Overview

This C++ project provides a solver for Countdown problems, inspired by the British TV show "Countdown." The solver uses RPN to determine if it's possible to reach a target number by applying basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to a set of given numbers.

## Features

1. **RPN Notation:**
   - The project utilizes Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) for a concise and efficient representation of arithmetic expressions.

2. **Countdown Problem Solving:**
   - Given a set of numbers and a target, the solver determines if it's possible to reach the target using the provided numbers and basic arithmetic operations.

## Countdown Problem

- Countdown problems involve reaching a target number by applying basic arithmetic operations to a set of given numbers.
- Only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are allowed.
- Intermediate results and operands are represented using RPN
